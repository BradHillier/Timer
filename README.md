This project is a timer application built using React. The timer has three modes: "setTime", "countDown", and "alarm". In the "setTime" mode, the user can input a time in the format HHMMSS using the number buttons provided. The user can also start the countdown using the "Start" button or clear their input using the "Clear" button. In "countDown" mode, the timer counts down from the user-specified time and displays the remaining time. The user can pause the countdown using the "Pause" button, and resume the countdown using the "Resume" button. When the countdown reaches 00:00:00, the timer enters "alarm" mode, in which an alarm sound plays. The user can stop the alarm by clicking the "Stop" button. In any mode, the user can return to "setTime" mode by clicking the "Cancel" button.
